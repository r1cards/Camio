			<h2>Why did we chose these specific scenarios?</h2>
			<h3>Outdoor</h3>
			<p>In the exterior photos we can fully appreciate the dynamic range of the cameras sensor, as well as the details in the edges of the objects.</p>
			<h3>Indoor</h3>
			<p>The interior photos are made with artificial lights that are not always bright, so that we are able to see how much <dfn title="a random variation in brightness or color in images">noise</dfn> is present aswell as the color fidelity in these conditions.</p>
			<h3>Low light</h3>
			<p>In the exterior photos with very low light we can appreciate the ability of the camera sensor to capture images without <dfn title="a random variation in brightness or color in images">noise</dfn> in these extreme lowlight conditions.</p>
			<h3>Flash</h3>
			<p>In photos taken with flash we should look at the power and brightness of the light and if it is able to capture a well detailed images.</p>
			<h3>Selfie</h3>
			<p>In these images we are able to see the capability of the front camera sensor when taking pictures of a person at a hand held distance.</p>
