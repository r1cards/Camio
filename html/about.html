		<h1 class="rightSlide animations">Have you ever wondered how good are some phone cameras compared to others?</h1>
		<p class="leftSlide animations">
			If so, then you found the right place. Here at Camio we take similar images with 
			different phone camera, we like it simple, so without any clever tech talk or
			clever editing you get to decide which phone cameras you would prefer.            
		</p>
		<h1 class="rightSlide animations">How do we take our images?</h1>
		<p class="leftSlide animations">
			We take our images very seriously, we grab a phone and use it for the duration of a day, like your average user 
			we occasionally take images using the stock camera settings, after the images have been taken we sort them out into categories.  
		</p>
		<h1 class="rightSlide animations">How can I get a specific phone onto the gallery page?</h1>
		<p class="leftSlide animations">
			You can visit our <a href="contacts.html" id="contactLink">contact</a> page and send us a request,
			and we will try to update our gallery as soon as possible. 
		</p>
		<h1 class="rightSlide animations">Have some cool ideas that would work well on our website?</h1>
		<p class="leftSlide animations">
			Feel free to share them with us, and if we like them, we will add the to the website.
